### TO DO LIST

[DEMO!](https://todolist-spawd.netlify.app/)

My first app built using **React**

* Clicking on the task circle marks it as complete.

* Clicking on the **(!)** symbol marks it '_in progress_'.

* Click the **X** button to remove a task

* A search bar is included to filter your long to do list

* Tasks can also be filtered depending on their status as pending, completed or in progress
